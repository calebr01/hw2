Provides a basic understanding of Image Responsiveness/Art Direction w/ HTML

a website that consists of three web pages: 
  - a page which contains a responsive image for the resolution switching use-case, 
  - a page which contains a responsive image for the art direction use-case, 
  - an index.html which links to them both.
  
For the resolution-switching image, 
- use at least one media condition in the sizes attribute (so that something about the display size of the image changes at some reasonable breakpoint),
- at least 3 underlying image files for the srcset, using width descriptors (e.g. 500w - not the 2x stuff).  
The underlying images should all "look the same" and be the same aspect ratio, but provide different resolutions.  

For the art-direction image, 
- use at least two underlying image files, but they should look substantially different (in terms of cropping or aspect ratio, etc.).
